## 🚀 Deployment Notes

### Production Checklist

1. **Update environment variables:**

   ```env
   # In production .env
   SMTP_HOST=your-production-smtp-host
   SMTP_USER=noreply@yourdomain.com
   SMTP_PASS=production-password
   ```

2. **Update voice agent API URL:**

   ```env
   # In voice-agent production .env
   NEXTJS_API_URL=https://yourdomain.com
   ```

3. **Consider email service:**

   - Gmail: Good for testing, 500 emails/day limit
   - SendGrid: 100 emails/day free, then paid
   - AWS SES: $0.10 per 1000 emails, very reliable
   - Postmark: Transactional email specialist

4. **Monitor email deliverability:**
   - Set up SPF, DKIM, DMARC records
   - Monitor bounce rates
   - Check spam folder regularly
